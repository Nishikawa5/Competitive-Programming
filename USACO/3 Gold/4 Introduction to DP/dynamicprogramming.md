### To solve with DP
Problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently
Think about the solution in terms of recursive functions

### There are two main DP approaches:
Push DP, where we update future states based on the current state
Pull DP, where we calculate the current state based on past states

Write the slowest solution first (see if it passes)
