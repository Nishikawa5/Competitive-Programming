A data structure is linear if its elements forms a linear sequence
for example: from left to right or bottom to top

Array:
We have static arrays and dynamic arrays

Static arrays - we can't change the size this type of array, the total size of array is declared one time
for example: int arr[10];

Dynamic arrays - we can change the size. Operate the same way as static array, but the size changes when it
reaches the max
for example: vector <int> arr; (in cpp)
we can make comparations if the data types are the same?

Sorting - we can use sort algorithms in arrays
cpp have built in sort function and we need cmp function to use that

Search - search for an specific element in an array
linear (n), binary search (logn and array must be sorted), hashing (constant)

Array of booleans (bitset)
