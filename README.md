# Competitive-Programming
In this repository, I will keep a collection of competitive programming problems I've solved to track and measure my progress.

### Current Approach
**Solving process**: Try to solve the problem for ~15 minutes. If i have no more ideas peak the solution and try again. Repeat it until the problem is solved.

**Selecting the problem**:
1. Solve problems by topic (learn this topic patterns):
   - Read the introduction of many topics and interleave the problems.
2. Solve problems randomly:
   -  Go to codeforces and pick problems of some range of rating where i can't solve most of them.
