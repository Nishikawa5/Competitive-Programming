In competitive programming, we are given already solved problems (not research).
Hiding the test data encourages the programmer to think about all corner cases of problem

Classify the problems
No Category Confidence and Expected Solving Speed
A1. I have solved this type before I am sure that I can re-solve it again (and fast)
A2. I have solved this type before I am sure that I can re-solve it again (but slow)
B. I have seen this type before But that time I know that I cannot solve it yet
C. I have not seen this type before See the discussion below

Some skills:
• Reducing the given problem into another (easier) problem,
• Reducing a known (NP-)hard problem into the given problem,
• Identifying subtle hints or special properties in the problem,
• Attacking the problem from a non-obvious angle/asking a different question,
• Compressing the input data,
• Reworking mathematical formulas,
• Listing observations/patterns,
• Performing case analysis of possible subcases of the problem, etc.
